# Visual Analytics for Data Science
## Visualizations of Energy Statistics

For my Data Visualisations I have used Altair and the Energy Datasets from Gapminder and the Internation Energy Agency.
- https://www.gapminder.org/data/
- https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/

You can find the rawdata in the directory data/raw/ . 
With the scrips in the directory src/ I have cleaned, aggregated and prepared the raw datasets and saved them in data/ .

The final preparation of the data, for the use with altair, happened in the notebooks/main-data-preparation.pynb file. The datasets for creating the altair charts were saved into data/melted_data/  and can be used directly with altair.
